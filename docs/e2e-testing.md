# E2E Testing

This document describes the local emulator validation surface for Tunguska and the canonical joint Tunguska + Anubis proof kept in this repository.

## Scope

The local E2E surface is split on purpose:

- `app/src/androidTest`: Tunguska-only instrumentation covering import, connect, stop, automation contract, Chrome IP proof, and split-routing proof
- `jointtesthost/src/androidTest`: neutral host for cross-app Tunguska + Anubis orchestration
- `trafficprobe`: helper app used to prove direct-vs-tunneled public IP behavior
- `tools/emulator`: emulator lifecycle, Chrome bootstrap, UI dumps, and diagnostics collection
- `tools/integration/run-anubis-e2e.ps1`: full joint Tunguska + Anubis headed-emulator run

The neutral host keeps the cross-app proof out of the production app package and makes the Anubis handoff easier to follow.

## Privacy Rules

- Keep real VLESS or REALITY fixtures outside git.
- Pass live fixtures through CLI arguments or `TUNGUSKA_REAL_SHARE_LINK`.
- Do not commit raw diagnostics from `logs/`.
- Share redacted exports or scrubbed logs when reporting issues outside the repo.
- Tracked tests use synthetic example profile data only.

## Environment

The PowerShell helpers now resolve their paths dynamically:

- Android SDK: `ANDROID_SDK_ROOT`, `ANDROID_HOME`, or `%LOCALAPPDATA%\Android\Sdk`
- Java: `JAVA_HOME`, or a standard `%ProgramFiles%\Java\jdk-24` install
- Anubis repo for the joint flow: `-AnubisRepo`, or a sibling checkout at `../anubis`

Required local pieces:

- a configured emulator AVD such as `tunguska-api34`
- Chrome in the system image or `tools/browser/chrome.apk`
- Shizuku, which the helper can install on demand
- a local Anubis checkout when running the joint proof

## Tunguska-Only Smoke

Run the local Tunguska smoke suite with a real share link:

```powershell
$env:TUNGUSKA_REAL_SHARE_LINK = "<real share link>"
.\tools\emulator\run-vpn-smoke.ps1
```

This flow starts the emulator, ensures Chrome is available, installs Tunguska plus the helper app, runs the app instrumentation, and pulls diagnostics into `logs/`.

## Joint Tunguska Plus Anubis Proof

The canonical joint proof is `io.acionyx.tunguska.trafficprobe.AnubisJointUiProofTest` hosted by `jointtesthost`.

Run it with:

```powershell
$env:TUNGUSKA_REAL_SHARE_LINK = "<real share link>"
.\tools\integration\run-anubis-e2e.ps1 -AnubisRepo ..\anubis
```

That runner performs this sequence:

1. boots a headed emulator
2. ensures Chrome and Shizuku are ready
3. installs Tunguska, `trafficprobe`, and `jointtesthost`
4. prepares the Tunguska automation fixture with the live share link
5. installs Anubis from the local checkout
6. runs the neutral-host joint instrumentation
7. pulls Tunguska and joint-host diagnostics into `logs/`

The acceptance bar is:

- Tunguska remains frozen while idle under Anubis control
- Anubis unfreezes Tunguska before automation start
- Tunguska reaches `RUNNING`
- the helper app observes a tunneled public IP different from the direct baseline
- Anubis stops Tunguska cleanly
- Tunguska returns to `IDLE`
- the direct public IP is restored
- Anubis freezes Tunguska again after shutdown

## Diagnostics

The helpers write local artifacts under `logs/`, including:

- `tunguska-smoke-*`
- `anubis-smoke-*`
- `ui-latest.xml`

These artifacts are intentionally git-ignored because they can contain device-local details, runtime state, and public IP observations from live validation.

## Sharing With The Anubis Author

When sharing this setup outside the repo, send:

- [docs/anubis-integration.md](./anubis-integration.md)
- [jointtesthost/README.md](../jointtesthost/README.md)
- [tools/integration/run-anubis-e2e.ps1](../tools/integration/run-anubis-e2e.ps1)

That combination shows the automation contract, the neutral-host structure, and the exact local runner without exposing a committed live fixture.
